        <h3>Cooking Tips</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To convection bake, reduce the temperature to 375°F and bake for 12-15 minutes (veggie and marg) or 10-13 (four cheese).</li>
            <li>We recommend baking our pizza directly on the oven rack so air can flow underneath, making it crispy all over but still doughy on the inside (and one less pan to wash!). The raised edge of the crust keeps everything in place so your oven will stay clean. If you prefer to bake on a pizza stone or baking sheet, keep it in the oven while it pre-heats to ensure the pizza gets crispy on the bottom.</li>
            <li>Turn on your oven light so you can watch as your pizzas bake! If your oven runs hotter on one side, rotate the pizza around halfway through. When it’s done baking, use tongs to pull your pizza directly onto a cutting board.</li>
            <li>Craving a grilled pizza? Set the heat on your grill to medium while letting your pizza sit out on a countertop at room temp for a few minutes. Grill, toppings side up, until cheese is melted and crust is lightly charred.</li>
